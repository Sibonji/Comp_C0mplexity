# Comp_Complexity

To run programm type in cmd line:
python3 merge_sort.py 

Output should be like this:

List length: 148926
Random list generated in 0.072922
Verification of sorting algorithm: True
Single Core elapsed time: 1.617683 sec
Starting parallel sort.
Performing final merge.
Final merge duration: 0.969226 sec
Sorted arrays equal: True
4-Core elapsed time: 1.238766 sec

When executing, code uses single core implementation to test if multicore implementation is correct and to compare performance of singlecore and multicore implemetation.

Merge Sort algorithm have complexity - $\theta$(nlogn).
